				Honey bees are not native to North America or a natural part of our ecosystems. But they are very important for crop production, and they give us hive products such as honey. Honey bee colonies are not declining, but they are a lot harder to keep healthy than they were in the past. This mainly is a result of pests and dieases such as the Varroa mite, poor nutrition and lack of floral resources, and exposure to pesticides. <br>(<a href="https://islandpollinatorinitiative.ca/">Island Pollinator Initiative</a>)
